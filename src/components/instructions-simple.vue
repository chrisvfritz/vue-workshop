    <h2>How to build simple Vue apps</h2>
    <p>For the examples in this exercise, all you'll need is an <code>index.html</code> file with the base content below. As you can see, it's just a regular HTML file with Vue pulled in from a CDN, just like you would do with jQuery!</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My Vue App&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/vue/latest/vue.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;!-- CODE FROM EXAMPlES GOES HERE! --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>There are also more complicated systems for building and using Vue components, most notably <a href="https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack" target="_blank">using npm and Webpack</a>, but we'll be starting with the simplest possible use of Vue, which will be applicable in most applications.</p>
